W11493,590,imgW1149301181472148,5820,1,7,62,3,8,NA,"[ HST ] : pt with history of throacic fracture t-10 and disabled [ SAS ] : as above with worsening pain Exam : MR lumbar spine without contrast History : pt with history of throacic fracture t-10 and disabled Comparison : Thoracic MRI performed same day . Technique : The following MR sequences of the lumbar spine were performed without contrast : Sagittal T1 , T2 , T2 FS , axial T1 , T2 Findings : Scoliosis again demonstrated . Thoracolumbar levoscoliosis and mid/lower lumbar dextroscoliosis . There is right lateral wedging of the T10 vertebral body , most likely due to old trauma . No acute osseous abnormality . The conus is normal in position and terminates at T12-L1 . Visualized retroperitoneal structures are normal . Based on sagittal sequences , there are 5 lumbar vertebra . Axial morphology : L1-2 : Minimal disc bulge and mild facet joint and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy . Central canal and foramina are patent . L2-L3 : Minimal disc bulge and mild facet joint and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy . Central canal and foramina are patent . L3-L4 : Minimal disc bulge and mild to moderate facet joint and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy . There is mild central canal narrowing . No significant foraminal stenosis . L4-L5 : Minimal disc bulge and mild to moderate facet joint and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy . Mild central canal narrowing . No significant foraminal stenosis . Small posterior midline annular tear noted . L5-S1 : No disc herniation . Mild facet joint and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy . Central canal and foramina are patent . Impression: 1.  Scoliosis again noted.  Old T10 trauma demonstrated.  No acute osseous abnormality. 2.  Multilevel degenerative disc and facet joint changes without significant central canal or foraminal stenosis. 3.  Mild central canal narrowing is noted at the L3-4 and L4-5 levels. 4.  Small posterior midline annular tear in the L4-5 disc.
